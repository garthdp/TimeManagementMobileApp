Our features:
Our application has a unique Agenda page where the user can see which categories of theirs still hasnt reached their minimal hours and lastly which categories
the user has completed for the day. In addition to the agenda page we have the navigation bar that allows users to navigate between the home, category and timesheet view.

Commit history:

If you look at the commit history it shows that only one person made commits this is because the application wouldn't work on partners PC so he made a seperate app which he did his part on then sent it through to me when finished where I then added it to the app.

Everyone contributed towards the project.
