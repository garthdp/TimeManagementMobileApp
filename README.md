To Run Project:

Download and run in andriod studio:

Click green "<> Code" button then download the zip file.

Unzip file and open in andriod studio where you can run it on the emulator of your choice or use your phone.

Bugs:

The app works perfectly on my phone but on the VM bluestacks emulator the UI get messy and bugs occur.

Trying to add an image to timesheet crashes the app on emulator but not on phone.

Trying to add timesheet crashes emulator but not my phone.

All testing was done on phone throughout development but when I tested on the VM bluestack emulator at the end of the project some stuff did not work properly on it but it still works on phone.

Commit history:

If you look at the commit history it shows that only one person made commits this is because the application wouldn't work on partners PC so he made a seperate app which he did his part on then sent it through to me when finished where I then added it to the app.

Everyone contributed towards the project.
